# Airegister (Front End) Application 

## Quick start
### Prerequisites
- node version >= 8.15.1
- npm version >= 5

### Steps
Install all the dependencies.

`npm install` | `npm i`

Create an environment file at the root of the project that will contain sensative info.

`touch process.env`

The file must have these properties. These are specific to the Auth0 Identity provider that you have to setup.

```
clientId=SOMELONGFAKECLIENTID
domain=somedomain.eu.auth0.com
audience=https://somedomain/registration
```
These properties are then used in an auth config file `app/auth_config.js` during run-time to establish a connection with the Auth0 Indentity Service.

Start the server.

`npm start`

Open a browser to http://localhost:3000
